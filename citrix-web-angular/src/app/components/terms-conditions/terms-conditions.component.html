            <h5>Legally binding agreement between ACM-CCAS Limited (ACM) and the Client. Valid from the point that the Client’s application for Registration is accepted by ACM.</h5>
            <p class="pt-4">1. <span>Introduction</span></p>
            <p class="pt-2">ACM is an independent certification body and these rules have been drawn up in accordance with the requirements placed on ACM by Accreditation Bodies such as UKAS. ACM shall abide by these requirements as specified in ISO 17021 or ISO 17065 and other related documents and standards. The scope of accreditation can be found on the UKAS web site <span>(ACM-CCAS Scope of Accreditation).</span> If a sector is outside the scope of accreditation then an unaccredited certificate may be offered at the discretion of ACM.</p>
            <p class="pt-2">Although not a statement guaranteeing that the product or services actually meet specified requirements, accredited certification of a management system is a measure of compliance, at the time of audit, with the appropriate international standards.</p>

            <p class="pt-4">2. <span>Introduction</span></p>
            <p class="pt-2">For the purpose of these Terms and Conditions:</p>
            <p class="pt-3"><span>Applicant;</span> means an individual, body corporate or body unincorporated applying for a Certificate of Registration.</p>
            <p class="pt-3"> <span>Audit/Assessment;</span> means a verification of the effectiveness of the relevant management systems and processes operated by an Applicant through the examination of materials, finished product, methods of test, records, systems, environmental and other activities established by the Applicant within its Management System.</p>
            <p class="pt-3"><span>Certificate of Registration;</span> means a document issued by ACM in recognition that the management system operated by the Applicant meets the requirements of the applicable Standard or Scheme and these Terms and Conditions.</p>
            <p class="pt-3"><span>Client;</span> Companies, organisations or parts thereof that are audited and certified by ACM.</p>
            <p class="pt-3"><span>Major non-conformance;</span> where there is a lack of evidence to demonstrate that a clause within a standard has been met. For example, no evidence, records or documents can be found or non-conformities raised at a previous audit have not been properly closed.</p>
            <p class="pt-3"><span>Minor non-conformance;</span> where there is a lack of evidence to demonstrate that a clause within a standard has been fully met. For example, some evidence, records or documents are available.</p>
            <p class="pt-3"><span>Observer/Witness;</span> means person who accompanies the audit team but does not act as an auditor.  An observer can be a regulator such as the SIA or Accreditation Body such as UKAS or other interested party.  In addition a technical expert may accompany an auditor but does not act as an auditor in the audit team unless qualified to do so.</p>
            <p class="pt-3"><span>Registration;</span> The process by which Clients gain and maintain certification against a standard. Registration covers all certification activities, including all activities required outside the certification process required to maintain Registration. For example, payment terms and conditions, regulatory requirements.</p>
            <p class="pt-3"><span>Registered Company; </span> means an individual, body corporate or body unincorporated which has been granted a Certificate of Registration.</p>
            <p class="pt-3"><span>Services;</span> as set out in the quotation</p>
            <p class="pt-3"><span>Scope of Registration; </span> means the range of products, services, activities covered by the management system of a registered company specified on the Certificate of Registration.</p>
            <p class="pt-3"><span>Standard; </span> means the Standards or other requirements for which the applicant organisation is seeking certification.</p>
            <p class="pt-4">3. <span>Scope of the Rules of Registration</span></p>
            <p class="pt-2">These rules of registration are applicable to all audits undertaken by ACM (or its local representatives) within the current scope of accreditation as detailed on the UKAS web site. In fulfilling this scope, the Client agrees to supply all necessary information to ACM so that a full and fair assessment can be undertaken. ACM will give due notice of any changes to its requirements and will verify that each certified Client complies with the new requirements. This agreement is applicable to all sites as listed on the certificate or attached schedule.</p>
            <p class="pt-2">ISO 45001 requirements: – This contract requires that the certified Client informs the Certification Body, without delay, of the occurrence of a serious incident or breach of regulation necessitating the involvement of the competent regulatory authority.</p>

            <p class="pt-4">4. <span>Personnel, Impartiality and Confidentiality</span> </p>
            <p class="pt-2">ACM undertakes to provide suitably qualified and technically competent personnel for all audit and surveillance activities using their own staff or suitable qualified and competent associates. All members of ACM (full-time employees, associates or local representatives) are required to sign confidentiality agreements concerning all confidential information to which they may be exposed. They are required to declare any conflict of interest prior to an audit or as soon as they become aware of a threat to the impartiality of the audit.</p>
            <p class="pt-2">The Client will be notified in advance of the lead auditor’s name and who will be attending.</p>
            <p class="pt-2">To maintain impartiality, it is a condition of the Passport Scheme and ACS Standard Route Scheme that applicants/ registered companies allow the certification body to rotate its assessors at least once in a three year period.</p>
            <p class="pt-2">All information acquired by ACM about an applicant or a registered company shall be confidential and, except as required by an accreditation body or regulator or for input to required industry databases, shall not be disclosed to a third party without prior written agreement of the company concerned. ACM does reserve the right to inform the relevant authorities if breaches of legislation are found as part of the audit process. <span>Click Here</span> to see our privacy notice.</p>
            <p class="pt-2">All certification activities and the management of impartiality are overseen by the Directors of ACM Ltd. Risks to impartiality are reviewed by an Independent Certification Board.</p>

            <p class="pt-4">5. <span>Access and Safety</span> </p>
            <p class="pt-2">The Client is responsible for ensuring that when ACM visits your site ACM has adequate protective equipment for the working environment to be assessed. Where specialist training is required this shall be disclosed to ACM at the outset. Clients shall raise these issues with ACM in advance of a visit.</p>
            <p class="pt-2">To ensure an effective audit, Clients are required to make all necessary arrangements for the conduct of the audit, including access to all processes and areas within the organisation, records and personnel.  This policy also applies to follow up audits following a complaint received from an interested party, for example, about the products/services provided by the certified organisation.</p>

            <p class="pt-4">6. <span>Application for Initial Registration</span> </p>
            <p class="pt-2">On receiving a completed Application Form/Request for Quotation ACM or its local representative will prepare a quotation detailing audit cost which will be forwarded to the Client. You agree to accept these terms and conditions by signing and returning your quotation document.</p>
            <p class="pt-2">On receipt of the signed acceptance of the quote, ACM or its local representative will issue an invoice to the Client who in turn will make payment to ACM or its local representative. The audit will then be planned and carried out in accordance with ACM accredited management system processes.</p>
            <p class="pt-2">The process for initial registration normally involves an on-site stage 1 audit of the management system and a subsequent on-site stage 2 audit of the implementation of that system.</p>
            <p class="pt-2">It is the responsibility of the applicant to satisfy themselves that the proposed scope of registration meets their requirements. Changes to the scope following acceptance of the quotation could result in amendment to the fees.</p>
            
            <p class="pt-4">7. <span>Changes to your Organisation</span> </p>
            <p class="pt-2">It is a condition of this agreement that you inform ACM of any substantive changes that take place or are planned to take place in or to your structure, strategy, management or culture (a “change”) which could affect your certificate.</p>
            <p class="pt-2">Without limitation, a change may include any merges, acquisitions, takeovers, new brand using existing people, cases of significant growth or reduction in employee numbers and changes in name or ownership. You must inform ACM prior to the change taking place or, if this is not possible, as soon as is reasonably practicable following the change.</p>
            <p class="pt-2">ACM reserves the right to investigate the nature of any change and its impact on your certification. Wherever possible, this investigation shall be timed to take place with a routine assessment of your certification. There may be a requirement to re-quote in line with the new changes and you will be notified of this prior to the assessment taking place.</p>
        
            <p class="pt-4">8. <span>Audit Method</span> </p>
            <p class="pt-2">The first stage of the audit requires the Auditor to conduct an on-site readiness review of the Client’s management system to assess the documentation and if the implementation of the management system is at a level sufficient to progress to the Stage two audit.</p>
            <p class="pt-2">When satisfied with the compliance of the documentation and system readiness the Auditor will produce a report and will agree a date with the Client for the Stage 2 audit. The Stage 2 audit will then be conducted in accordance with ACM accredited management system processes. If further visits are required, due to non-compliances found, these will be undertaken and the Client will be liable for any extra charges incurred based on the current audit day rate in the quotation. The audit will be carried out against agreed audit criteria.</p>
            <p class="pt-2">Once registration has been obtained the Client will be under a duty to notify ACM of any changes that significantly affect the registration. ACM may re-audit if necessary (short notice) due to the significant changes or as a result of any complaint, or follow up on suspended clients. If any additional charges are incurred ACM reserve the right to pass these additional charges on to the Client.</p>
            <p class="pt-2">ISO 45001 requirements: If the Client provides services at another organisation’s premises, we will verify that the client’s OH&SMS covers these offsite activities (notwithstanding the OH&SMS obligations of the other organization). In determining the time to be spent for audit, we shall consider to audit periodically any organization site where these employees work. Whether all sites shall be audited will depend on various factors such as OH&S risks associated with the activities therein performed, contract agreements, being certified by another accredited CAB, internal audit system, statistics on accidents and near misses.</p>
            <p class="pt-2">Audit methodology will include interviews, observation of activities, electronic and hard copy document and record review. Conclusions will be based on the evidence obtained during the audit. The auditor(s) will use sampling techniques to obtain the evidence and no guarantee can be given that a different conclusion may have been reached previously or if a different sample had been taken.</p>
          
            <p class="pt-4">9. <span>Certification</span> </p>
            <p class="pt-2">On completion of the audit the Auditor will submit the report with a recommendation for either granting or refusing registration. A suitably qualified, independent and authorised member of the ACM team will make the certification decision and authorise the issue of the certificate.</p>
            <p class="pt-2">Any non-conformities raised during an audit must be corrected and closed prior to a certification decision being made. The Client agrees to meet the extra visit or documentation review costs involved in closing out the non-conformities.</p>
            <p class="pt-2">Certificates will not be issued unless payment in full has been received. The certificate remains the property of ACM and is valid for three years, providing the client maintains the management system to the required standard.</p>

            <p class="pt-4">10. <span>Annual Registration, Surveillance, Re-certification and  Special / Short Notice Visits</span> </p>
            <p class="pt-2">After the issue of a certificate, planned surveillance visits will be carried out by an Auditor at the Client’s premises at least annually in order to maintain registration. If areas of concern are identified, more visits may be carried out at the discretion of the ACM Management. Major non-conformities identified at a surveillance visit must be corrected by the Client within the timescales agreed with the auditor and closed out by ACM either by document / record review or additional site visit. The Client agrees to meet the extra costs relating to any additional close out work required.</p>
            <p class="pt-2">Minor non-conformities identified at a surveillance must be corrected in the agreed timescale. The action taken will be checked at the next scheduled audit. ACM may require the Client to send evidence to confirm that effective action has been taken. Failure to address minor non-conformities may result in escalation to a major non-conformance and in such cases the Client agrees to meet extra costs relating to additional close out work.</p>
            <p class="pt-2">Following a Stage 2 audit Clients must undertake their first surveillance before the first anniversary date of their certificate. If this is not completed on time for any reason the certificate will be suspended. Following suspension, failure to complete within three months will result in certificate withdrawal.</p>
           
            <p class="pt-4"><span>Re- Certification:</span> A certificate will normally be valid for a period of three years (subject to ongoing compliance as detailed in these terms and conditions) A re-certification audit is required to maintain registration. The Client will notify ACM without delay of any matters incurred that may affect the capability of the management system to fulfil requirements.</p>
            <p class="pt-2">The re-certification audit must take place prior to the expiry of the certificate. Should the audit identify any non-conformities these must be corrected by the Client within the agreed timescale agreed with the auditor and subsequently closed out by ACM.</p>
            
            
            <p class="pt-4"><span>Special Visits:</span> Work required to close out improvements needs or non-conformities on, for example, ISO/ ACS Passport Assessments may require additional revisit audits. The Client agrees to meet the additional costs and these will be quoted by ACM in advance.</p>
            <p class="pt-2">In addition, if a complaint is made about a certified Client, or we have received notification of any changes we reserve the right to undertake a special / revisit audit to investigate whether the company is still meeting the requirements of the appropriate standard they are approved to. The client agrees to meet these additional costs.</p>
            <p class="pt-2">Independently from the involvement of the competent regulatory authority, a special / revisit audit may be necessary in the event that ACM becomes aware that there has been a serious incident related to occupational health and safety, for example, a serious accident, or a serious breach of regulation, in order to investigate if the management system has not been compromised and did function effectively. ACM shall document the outcome of its investigation.</p>
            <p class="pt-2">Information on incidents such as a serious accident, or a serious breach of regulation necessitating the involvement of the competent regulatory authority, provided by the certified Client or directly gathered by the audit team during the special / revisit audit, shall provide grounds for CCAS to decide on the actions to be taken, including a suspension or withdrawal of the certification, in cases where it can be demonstrated that the system seriously failed to meet the OH&S certification requirements.</p>

            <p class="pt-4">11. <span>Extension or Revision to the Scope of Registration</span> </p>
            <p class="pt-2">This may be applied for in the same way as the initial audit, indicating the increased scope of registration required. The audit will be carried out in the areas not previously audited. If successful, a new certificate indicating the new scope will be issued by ACM. There will be a charge for extensions to scope and the re-issuing of the certificate. Should a certified scope be reduced, the Client will amend all advertising matter.</p>
            <p class="pt-2">If a Client is already registered to a particular standard, for example ISO 45001 and subsequently wishes to add an additional standard such as ISO 9001, this will be treated as a new application and the Rules of Registration relating to initial audits shall be followed.</p>

            <p class="pt-4">12. <span>Publicity & Privacy</span> </p>
            <p class="pt-2"> When a certificate has been issued, the Client has the right to publish the fact. The relevant accreditation marks and logos can be used on stationery and websites relating only to the audited scope of registration and standard. A separate document relating to the use of certification marks and logos will be issued by ACM at the time of registration. ACM will make available on request, the certification status of any client. The use of any logos must abide by the ACM branding guidelines.</p>
            <p class="pt-2">The Client must not make or permit any misleading statement regarding its certification, the scope and/or standards covered, the Client’s locations covered by certification. Any references to a Client’s management system must not imply that ACM certifies a product, service or process.</p>
            <p class="pt-2">The Client must not apply certification marks or accreditation marks to laboratory test, calibration or inspection reports as such reports are deemed to be products.</p>
            <p class="pt-2">ACM will contact the Client in relation to organising their certification and to inform/provide information or facts of relevance to their certification. A copy of the Privacy notice can be found <span>by clicking here</span> and is available on the ACM website.</p>

            <p class="pt-4">13. <span>Logo and Certificate Misuse</span> </p>
            <p class="pt-2">The Client shall adhere to the ACM branding guidelines, throughout the certification. The branding guidelines will be sent to the Client with the certification marks and logos on successful outcome of the initial certification.</p>
            <p class="pt-2">ACM will take all necessary steps to ensure that there is no misuse of the accreditation marks and logos or the certificate by the Client. The Client undertakes not to misuse or misrepresent the marks and logos or the certificate in any way.</p>

            <p class="pt-4">14. <span>Fees</span> </p>

            <p class="pt-4">16. <span>Cancellation of Planned Audits</span> </p>
            <p class="pt-2">ACM is committing resource when agreeing audit dates. Future audit dates are normally agreed between the auditor and Client during an audit and will be recorded in the report. Also, ACM and the Client will agree dates which will be confirmed by ACM in writing. It is not our policy to issue reminders and it is the Client’s responsibility to ensure that the audit can be delivered in accordance with the plan. Consequently, a fee will be charged if a visit is postponed or cancelled within 20 working days of the first day on site. The cancellation fee will be on a sliding scale, based on a percentage of the quoted days.</p>
            <p class="pt-2">Where ACM incurs a cost for technical experts, UKAS or other accreditation body observers as result of a Client postponement or cancellation these fees will be charged at cost to the Client.</p>

            <p class="pt-4">17. <span>Appeals Procedure</span> </p>
            <p class="pt-2"> If for any reason a Client disagrees with the Auditor’s verdict they are at liberty to lodge an appeal with ACM’s Managing Director. All appeals will be held in the presence of an Independent Certification Board sub-committee. The sub-committee will hear evidence from the Client’s representative and the relevant Auditor. The decision of the Independent Certification Board is final and binding on both the Client and ACM. No counter claims will be allowed by either party. No costs, for whatever reason, will be allowed for either party as a result of an appeal. Expenses of the appeal will be met in full by the party who has the decision against them.</p>

            <p class="pt-4">18. <span>Client Complaints against ACM Personnel</span> </p>
            <p class="pt-2">If a Client has reason for a complaint this should be submitted in writing to ACM. Documented procedures for handling complaints can be found on the ACM website. All complaints will be responded to in line with the timelines set out in our procedures and will be investigated thoroughly. Results will be sent in writing to the Client. Following investigation, if the Client is not satisfied with the outcome it will be referred to a Director or the Client may be asked to lodge an appeal.</p>

            <p class="pt-4">19. <span>Complaints against the Registered Company</span> </p>
            <p class="pt-2">The Client agrees to make available to ACM or its representative all information pertaining to complaints received by the client from customers, regulators and any other interested parties. In the event of an alleged breach of relevant legislative or regulatory requirement the ACM Client/registered company must inform ACM as soon as possible.</p>

            <p class="pt-4">20. <span>Audit Team</span> </p>
            <p class="pt-2"> ACM will provide an appropriately qualified, competent and impartial audit team or individual auditor to deliver the agreed audit plan. In addition, the auditor / audit team may be accompanied by a technical expert, translator or interpreter. The Client has the right to object to any individual auditor but must do so immediately upon notification of the auditor/audit team. ACM reserves the right to change the assigned auditor(s) or add additional auditors to meet operational requirements.</p>
            <p class="pt-2">The Client does not have the right to require that a specific named auditor conducts a particular audit.</p>
            <p class="pt-2">To maintain impartiality ACM will review from time to time the frequency of audits undertaken by an auditor with a particular Client. If ACM considers that impartiality is threatened due to familiarity then it may be necessary to change the auditor.</p>
            <p class="pt-2">From time to time the auditor / audit team may be accompanied by a trainee. A trainee has no status on the audit and will at all times be under the supervision of a lead auditor. Clients will not be charged for a trainee and advance permission for attendance will always be sought from the Client.</p>
            <p class="pt-2">The Client in agreeing the Rules of Registration also agrees that no pressure, intimidation or inducement will be offered to ACM auditors or staff designed to change or alter a decision. All instances will be reported to ACM.</p>

            <p class="pt-4">21. <span>Witnessed Audits by Accreditation and Authorised Bodies</span> </p>
            <p class="pt-2">It is a condition of these Rules of Registration that all ACM certificated Clients should, if requested, allow representatives of accreditation or regulatory bodies such as UKAS or the Security Industry Association (SIA) to witness ACM staff carrying out audits. Failure to allow this could jeopardise the Client’s registration. The presence of any observers will be agreed prior to any audit. Observers will have no influence over the outcome of the audit.</p>
